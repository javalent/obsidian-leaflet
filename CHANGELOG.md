Highlights:

3. You can now view detailed health data on the map, including elevation, pace, cadence and more!

5. You can now draw and edit shapes directly on maps!
6. For those of you using Obsidian to run TTRPGs, Leaflet now integrates directly with the Initiative Tracker, giving you the ability to use it as a full-on battlemap.
7. You can now specify alternate map serves other than OpenStreetMap, and real-world maps can now have multiple layers.
8. The plugin now has full localization support (but currently only supports English).

Several bug fixes.

## 3.18.0

- Added support for GeoJSON styling using the MapBox SimpleStyle specification
- GeoJSON now displays a tooltip if the features have a `title`, `description` or `name` specified
- The default GeoJSON color can be set with the new `geojsonColor` parameter
- Fixed issue where maps would not load if a non-markdown file was present in the immutable file list

## 3.17.0

-   Added support for GeoJSON files
-   Added support for `mapmarkers` frontmatter tag
-   Backend updates

## 3.16.0

-   Added file watchers to automatically update immutable markers and overlays when note frontmatter changes
-   Fixed issue where `zoomDelta` was not respected when using scroll wheel

## 3.15.0

-   Added `linksTo` and `linksFrom` parameters

-   Add new `coordinates` and `zoomTag` parameter
    -   `coordinates` can be used in lieu of `lat` and `long` parameters
    -   If the `coordinates` is a note file wikilink, it will read the note file's `location` frontmatter tag and use that for initial starting coordinates
    -   If `zoomTag` is specified, it will read the tag from the frontmatter of the _same_ file specified in `coordinates`. If `coordinates` is not a file, `zoomTag` does nothing. - It will use the tag (formatted the same as `overlayTag` - `<distance> <unit>`) to calculate the default zoom level to display

## 3.14.0

-   Close #74 - Added `bounds` parameter to set custom image map coordinates
-   Greatly improved error reporting

-   Fixed issue where overlays drawn directly on image maps would not re-render correctly
-   Fixed issue where overlays defined with a non-hex color would display black in the color-picker
-   Fixed issue where edited parameters in the overlay context menu were not correctly applied
-   Overlay radiuses in the context menu now correctly display the radius in the correct unit
-   Improved visual appearance of a loading map
-   Improved documentation

## 3.12.0

-   Added ability to upload images to use as marker icons
    -   Images will be resized to 24px wide maximum
    -   Markers with image icons cannot be layered
    -   If the default marker is set to an image, additional marker types cannot be layered
-   Improved behavior of Filter Marker control box

-   Maps are now generated by a Markdown render child generator
-   Maps now handle their own escape scopes
-   Image maps now load the first image then load remaining images in the background
-   Improved image rendering speed
-   Added ability to define `image`, `marker`, `commandMarker`, `markerFile`, `markerFolder`, and `markerTag` parameters using YAML syntax instead of multiple parameter tags
    -   `markerTag` instances cannot be defined using # in YAML - # denotes a comment
    -   YAML-style syntax cannot be combined with original syntax
-   Added basic circle map overlays
    -   Can be created on the map by <kbd>Shift</kbd>-right clicking on a point to begin drawing
    -   Can be defined in source block using new `overlay` parameter

    -   Please see [the ReadME section](./README.md#Overlays) for syntax
-   Fixed several issues related to marker filter control box

-   Moved Bulk Edit Markers to Top Right
    -   Top Left -> View Controls
    -   Top Right -> Layer controls (incl. markers)
    -   Bottom Left -> Distance controls

## 3.9.2

-   In an effort to reduce notice spam, copying map/marker coordinates now must be done by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd>/<kbd>Alt</kbd>-clicking

## 3.9.0

## 3.0.0

### New Features

-   Map IDs are now required.
    -   A map that does not have an id will **not render**
    -   The plugin will try to load previously defined marker data once an id has been given to the map.
    -   This means marker definitions are no longer tied to maps - giving a map on a different note the same ID will load the same marker data
-   Marker data that is not associated with a file will now be deleted after 7 days to prevent data accumulation
-   Map data is now only saved if the map has defined markers
-   Image files can now be linked using an Obsidian wikilink (e.g., [[Image Name.jpg]])
-   New `markerFile` and `markerFolder` parameters in maps
    -   `markerFile` will read a note file's frontmatter and create a marker based on the `marker` and `location` tags
        -   `marker` should be a defined marker type (will default to `default` if not provided)
        -   `location` should be a array of [latitude, longitude]. **If not provided, the marker will not be created**
        -   The marker link target will be set to the file
    -   `markerFolder` will read _all_ of the files in the folder, and try to parse the frontmatter as above.
-   Made display of marker link in tooltip consistent with Obsidian's display style
-   Added data attributes to marker HTML element
    -   data-type: marker type
    -   data-link: marker link target, if any
    -   data-mutable: whether marker data can be edited
    -   data-type: marker type name (such as default)
-   Switched from uuid to 6 digit nanoid
-   Rendering improvements

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed issue where having the same map open in multiple windows was not adding markers correctly
-   Fixed issue where dragging a marker created on a map open in multiple views would not drag correctly on other maps
-   Fixed issue where turning the plugin off would leave map tiles in random locations on open notes
-   Fixed issue where showing the note preview of a note with a map that is already open in the workspace would cause the map to be disassociated
